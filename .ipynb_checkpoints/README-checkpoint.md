# Clustering Analysis of the Iowa Gambling Task
> This project will explore the data from the Iowa Gambling task using unsupervised learning algorithms. The data used for this project can be found [_here_](http://doi.org/10.5334/jopd.ak). The resulting jupyter book can be found [_here_](https://dockreg.github.io/ca4015_assignment_1/intro.html)

## General Information
- This project aims to explore unsupervised learning techniques
- It will also provide experience using jupyter notebooks, git, markdown, and clustering analysis


## Requirements

- python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- jupyter-book
- numpy
- scipy
- sklearn
- array


## Usage
To build the book - ensure all requirements have been imported to the appropriate environment and then enter the following commands

```
jupyter-book build ca4015_assignment_1/
```

then followed by 

```
ghp-import -n -p -f ca4015_assignment_1/_build/html
```

This will build the online book in a seperate gh-pages branch


## Project Status
Project is: completed


## Room for Improvement

I would like to further investigate this data set and my methods around k-means clustering. I would like to gain some further insights around trends for healthy individuals vs those with prefrontal cortex health issues. As this was my first project using k-means I would like to delve further into its uses, and any limitations it may have as an unsupervised learning algorithm




```python
